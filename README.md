## 📌 Overview

**Saccharum-GAP-Net** is a transfer learning framework for automatic classification of sugarcane leaf diseases from RGB images captured in real farm environments.

The central architectural idea is simple:

> Replace heavy fully connected layers with **Global Average Pooling (GAP)** to reduce parameter count, control overfitting, and enable lightweight deployment.

The framework is designed for real-world agricultural use, including mobile and edge-based screening tools.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reduce overfitting on small agricultural datasets  
- Improve robustness to field lighting variations  
- Minimize model size without sacrificing accuracy  
- Support mobile and low-resource deployment
